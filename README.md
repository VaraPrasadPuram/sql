# SQL

This repository was created to showcase how I use SQL to consistently and efficiently query, define, manipulate, and control data. In this repo, you'll find two files under the ```examples``` folder, ```leetcode``` and ```strata```. These folders contains the questions and my solutions to these problems.

## Acknowledgements

- This problems and solutions are recent as of April 2022. I recognize that this repo might not be the most up-to-date resource, however, directionally it should prove to be useful for both those assessing my competency and those looking for reasources to help them learn the language.
