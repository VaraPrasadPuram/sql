-- Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.

-- Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
 

-- | x  | y  |
-- |----|----|
-- | -1 | -1 |
-- | 0  | 0  |
-- | -1 | -2 |
 

-- The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
 

-- | shortest |
-- |----------|
-- | 1.00     |
 

-- Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.

-- This problem shows knowledge in CROSS JOIN, SQRT, POW
