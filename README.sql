/*
SQL

This repository was created to showcase how I use SQL to consistently and efficiently query, define, manipulate, and control data. In this repo, you'll find two files under the "examples" folder, "leetcode" and "strata". These folders contains the questions and my solutions to these problems.


Acknowledgements

- This problems and solutions are recent as of April 2022. I recognize that this repo might not be the most up-to-date resource, however, directionally it should prove to be useful for both those assessing my competency and those looking for reasources to help them learn the language.
